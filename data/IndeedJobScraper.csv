Today’s Data Scientists are in pain - spending their time manually wrangling data, building models through slow trial and error, taking on painstaking rewrites for deployment, and dealing with countless other frustrating bottlenecks. And the tools they are using for much of this work – e.g. Jupyter notebooks and Pandas – are over a decade old.

We founded Delphina to change this: our mission is to help the world get better at using data to understand the present and predict the future. Delphina is an AI Agent for Data Science: leveraging a combination of generative AI, large scale optimization, and specialized infrastructure to automate the time-consuming but necessary tasks to build powerful ML models quickly; Delphina will identify relevant data, clean it, train models, and even productionize pipelines.

Our team has previously led large data science and machine learning teams (covering both applications and infrastructure), built startups, and created successful tools for enterprise ML.

We're backed by top AI investors, including Fei-Fei Li, Radical VC, and Costanoa VC.

Schmidt Sciences is a nonprofit organization founded in 2024 by Eric and Wendy Schmidt that works to accelerate scientific knowledge and breakthroughs with the most promising, advanced tools to support a thriving planet. The organization prioritizes research in areas poised for impact including AI and advanced computing, astrophysics, biosciences, climate, and space—as well as supporting researchers in a variety of disciplines through its science systems program.

Summary

The Astrophysics Institute at Schmidt Sciences seeks a Data Management & Software Systems expert to guide the design and implementation of next-generation data management systems for astronomy. This role is ideal for a technically fluent leader who bridges astronomy, data engineering, and software architecture — someone who understands the full life cycle of astronomical data and can oversee complex, distributed systems built to serve the global scientific community.

The successful candidate will help shape the Institute’s data management strategy, overseeing teams and partners building data pipelines, archives, and user-facing tools for ground- and space-based observatories. This is a rare opportunity to define how philanthropy can accelerate scientific discovery through robust, open, and interoperable data infrastructure.

The Astrophysics Institute at Schmidt Sciences aims to rapidly expand our knowledge of the universe through the creation of innovative hardware and software platforms. This includes the development of computational tools and frameworks, ground and space-based instrumentation, and the promotion of fresh approaches to technological advancement that develop resources at a fraction of the typical time and cost.

The Role

Reporting to the Director of the Astrophysics Institute, the Data Management & Software Systems Expert will guide the architecture, integration, and strategy of data management systems across the Institute’s observatory and mission portfolio.

This person will define system-level requirements, evaluate technical designs, and ensure that data infrastructure developed by partners and grantees meets the highest standards of interoperability, performance, and accessibility. They will be responsible for identifying and selecting qualified external vendors and contractors, establishing contractual agreements, and overseeing their work throughout project lifecycles. They will not necessarily write production code but must understand the systems deeply enough to direct, review, and synthesize the work of multiple teams.

Key responsibilities for this role include the following:
Data Systems Architecture and Strategy
Develop and refine the architecture for data management systems supporting Schmidt Sciences–funded observatories and instruments.
Define system-level requirements and workflows — from raw telemetry to science-ready archives — ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and open access.
Establish technical standards and documentation frameworks for data pipelines, archives, and analysis services.

At Rox, we believe in empowering people to do their best work.

Our platform supercharges sellers with autonomous revenue agents to do the manual work so they can focus on what they do best: selling. Just as coding agents 10x’d engineering, revenue agents 10x customer work.

We are reimagining the revenue stack by building the world’s first revenue operating system, from the application layer to the system of context. With Rox, humans are evolving to orchestrators while agents manage the end-to-end customer lifecycle.

Rox powers Global 2000 leaders in banking, hardware, construction, and sovereign AI, while serving dominant AI winners like Ramp and Cognition.

Underlying all of this success is a unwavering, shared belief in the mission, with an unreasonable commitment of doing whatever it takes to make it a reality.

The Team

Nothing is possible without the world-class team, assembled to redefine how businesses operate.

Members on our team have:

Founded and exited successful companies

Held the highest positions at Google, AWS, Confluent, and New Relic

Won IMO and IOI gold medals

Published field-defining papers

We’re backed by the best, having raised $50M from Sequoia (Alfred Lin), General Catalyst (Hemant Taneja), Google Ventures, Elad Gil, and Chris Ré.

Core Principles
Taste: Craft beautiful experiences.

No matter how small, we strive to make sure every detail is right. We care deeply about every interaction, both in terms of whether it helps the seller get the job done, but also how the product makes them feel. We get a visceral feeling when something is off and stop at nothing to make sure we make it right. We never settle, continuously exploring ways to delight sellers.

Obsession: Commit unreasonably.

In all aspects of our craft, we commit. We not only are immediately reactive to customers’ requests but are proactive about driving value even before they ask. We are also obsessive about always learning and honing our craft, improving ourselves and product every single day.

Action: Get it done.

Talking is easy but the difference comes from the execution. We lean heavily towards making thoughtful yet fast decisions and delivering immediately. We play in a field where trust is paramount. We earn the trust and right to empower the best sellers by forging a history of over-delivering on the promise at record speed.

Role

As a Data Scientist at Rox, you will power the intelligence layer behind the world’s first revenue operating system. You’ll be responsible for the metrics, insights, and analytical frameworks that shape how we build product, operate as a business, and help our customers transform their revenue organizations.

This is a high-ownership, high-leverage role for someone who thrives at the intersection of data, GTM, product strategy, and operational excellence. You will work directly with leadership, engineering, and GTM pods to create clarity, drive decisions, and build the analytical foundations that scale with the company.

If you love turning ambiguity into structured insight, building clean data models, and influencing business strategy with evidence, this is the role for you.

Responsibilities

Build and maintain dashboards, KPIs, and the company-wide single source of truth for revenue, usage, and customer telemetry.

Partner with GTM leaders to drive segmentation, funnel insights, measurement of workflow adoption and ROI.

Ensure high-quality data foundations through dbt-style modeling, data consistency, instrumentation, and proactive improvement of data pipelines and reporting.

Run deep product and usage analytics—including experimentation frameworks—to inform product development, activation, retention, and enterprise rollout success.

Deliver strategic analyses and executive-ready insights to support leadership, board materials, and new revenue motions.

Create scalable documentation, metric dictionaries, automations, and enablement materials while onboarding teams into Rox’s data ecosystem.

Qualifications
Required

Degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics)

2–5+ years experience in fast-paced, high-growth companies supporting Sales, Finance, or Product

Strong SQL and Python skills, able to work efficiently with large, messy datasets

Experience working with dbt ecosystems (e.g, paradime, dbt)

Experience building dashboards in tools like Sigma, Looker, Tableau, Mode, or equivalent

Exceptional analytical rigor and structured problem-solving skills

Strong communication skills, able to translate complex data into simple narratives for executives

High energy, “no job is too small” mentality, and ability to operate with extreme ownership

Ability to context-switch rapidly and thrive in an environment of speed, ambiguity, and high expectations

Located in or willing to relocate to San Francisco

Preferred

Experience working directly with GTM organizations and leadership teams

Knowledge of revenue methodologies, KPIs, and operational models

Familiarity with data warehousing technologies

Experience designing semantic layers and metric governance processes

Ability to build minimal data apps, Python scripts, or automations to scale workflows

Experience supporting enterprise customers or working with B2B SaaS telemetry datasets

Position description

Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSUS) at the University of California, Berkeley invites applications for a pool of qualified temporary lecturers to teach DSUS courses should an opening arise. Screening of applicants is ongoing and will continue as needed. The number of positions varies from semester to semester (fall, spring and summer sessions), depending on the needs of the unit.

About DSUS

Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSUS) offers a range of academic, co-curricular, and enrichment programs-including the Data Science major and minor-with a wide-reaching impact both across UC Berkeley and beyond.

Designed in collaboration with faculty from across Berkeley, Data Science invests students with deep technical knowledge, expertise in how to apply that knowledge in a field of their choosing, and an understanding of the social and human contexts and ethical implications of how data are collected, analyzed, and used. This combination positions graduates to help inform and develop solutions to a range of pressing challenges, from adapting industry to a new world of data to amplifying learning in education to helping communities recover from disaster.

DSUS is part of the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS), which strives to develop, implement, and share high-quality, ethics-oriented, and accessible curricula, educating a diverse student body in data science, computing, and statistics. Core to the college is an understanding of how computing and data science affect equality, equity, and opportunity-and the capacity to respond to social challenges.

DSUS is committed to hiring and developing staff who want to work in a high performing culture that reflects the outstanding work of our faculty and students. DSUS seeks candidates who can support the success of all students through inclusive curriculum, classroom environment, and pedagogy.

Responsibilities

DSUS is seeking outstanding instructors to be appointed in the non-Senate Lecturer title series who can teach small and large courses in several areas. We are particularly interested in instructors who can combine computational and inferential thinking in a way that reflects the new field of Data Science Education.

Core courses include:
Fundamentals of Data Science
Principle and Techniques of Data Science
Human Contexts and Ethics of Data
Data and Justice
Data, Inference, and Decisions
Honors Thesis Seminar

Connector Courses: Instructors may be hired to teach Connector Courses that connect Foundations of Data Science with other disciplines, such as neuroscience, legal studies, public health, demography, English or others. Connector courses allow students to apply theoretical concepts from data science to a particular area of interest. Course design and syllabus will leverage the sequence of computational and statistical techniques that students learn in the Foundations course.

Teaching a Data Science course may include holding office hours, assign grades, advise students, prepare course materials (e.g., syllabus), provide clear and prompt feedback on student work, and maintain the course website.

Please note: The use of a lecturer pool does not guarantee that an open position exists. See the review date specified in AP Recruit to learn whether the unit is currently reviewing applications for a specific position. If there is no future review date specified, your application may not be considered at this time.

Description

The Connolly Alexander Institute for Data Science (CAIDS) seeks to hire a Professor of Practice in Data, who will teach introductory and multi-disciplinary courses in data literacy, presentation, management, and/or analysis. CAIDS promotes, teaches, and supports data literacy and data science for students, faculty, and the community. CAIDS programming includes courses, workshops, events, student internship and co-curricular experiences, research grants, interdisciplinary research groups, and statistical consulting. For more information on CAIDS, see datainstitute.tulane.edu.

This position has a teaching load of two courses per semester (i.e., a 2/2), which is the same teaching load as most tenure-track faculty at Tulane University. The Professor of Practice will be expected to teach DATA 1010 “Introduction to Data”. This course seeks to be accessible to students of all backgrounds and abilities and will teach them fundamental skills in data literacy, analysis, communication, and ethics. The Professor of Practice will also develop and teach one or two multi-disciplinary courses in data analysis, presentation, ethics, or management in their areas of interest or expertise. This position is a permanent one, with contracts renewed every three or five years. Renewal is based on an evaluation of teaching, service, and research (if part of the negotiated workload).

In addition to teaching, the Professor of Practice will develop and facilitate aspects of CAIDS programming or services around increasing the participation of faculty and students across CAIDS's existing and new programs while upholding CAIDS's mission of being inclusive to all data fields. Based on the candidate's expertise, possible service roles may include developing and coordinating internal and external internship programs, research assistant programs, grant coordination, developing and coordinating workshops and data-thons, student group advising, fostering partnerships with community organizations and community outreach partnerships (e.g. K-12 educational programming), overseeing annual programming such as the annual data theme and Love Data Week, or supporting interdisciplinary research groups in the Professor of Practice's area(s). The Professor of Practice will also have a role in helping direct and manage the focus and trajectory of CAIDS as an active and key partner. Conducting research is not a requirement for the Professor of Practice position, but data-related research or scholarship on data science teaching and learning can be incorporated into the workload. This deviates from most other Professor of Practice positions which do not provide time for research.

About General Medicine

We’re building a platform that makes it delightfully simple for people to find, book, and afford care across virtual and in-person visits, prescriptions, labs, imaging, and more.

As a Marketplace Scientist at General Medicine, you’ll work directly with our Chief Economist to design the algorithms, mechanisms, and models that underpin the matching, pricing, and insurance estimation systems at the heart of the business. From understanding patient preferences to forecasting prices across complex insurance networks, your work will determine how the marketplace functions and scales.

What we’re looking for

We’re looking for someone with a deep understanding of machine learning, marketplace design, and optimization —someone excited to turn elegant theory into practical, production-ready systems.

We especially value candidates who are comfortable reasoning from economic primitives; who understand how supply, demand, and incentives interact; and who can move fluidly between empirical work, and algorithm design. Familiarity with machine learning or prediction is helpful, especially for price estimation, but not the central focus.

You should be equally comfortable analyzing data, building models, and experimenting in production. You’ll work on mechanisms that must both reflect real-world behavior and scale operationally.

You should be excited to:

Design and evaluate matching algorithms that connect patients to clinicians for excellent outcomes and short time-to-care.

Build and test models that estimate prices, incorporating noisy, incomplete, or strategically selected data.

Construct demand and supply forecasts that support routing, capacity planning, and network design.

Work with rich operational datasets—cleaning, joining, interpreting, and stress-testing them—and help identify and integrate new data sources.

Collaborate with engineering to deploy model-driven mechanisms into production environments.

Run simulations, counterfactual analyses, and empirical studies to validate designs and inform marketplace strategy.

Ideal Qualifications

PhD in Economics, Operations Research, Computer Science, Applied Math, or a related quantitative field.

Familiarity with both economic modeling and machine learning or statistical prediction

Strong coding skills in Python and SQL, and comfort working with data

Prior business or startup experience is a plus, especially in analytics, pricing, or data-driven operational roles.

Our systems operate at exabyte scale, processing petabytes of data each day for some of the world’s most prominent enterprises in finance, technology, and industry. These systems are already making a measurable difference in how global organizations use data to deploy AI safely and efficiently.

We believe that the next generation of enterprise AI will not come from larger models but from more efficient data systems. By advancing the frontier of how data is represented, stored, and transformed, we aim to make large-scale intelligence creation sustainable and adaptive.

Our long-term vision is Efficient Intelligence: AI that learns using fewer resources, generalizes from less data, and reasons through structure rather than scale. To reach that, we are first building the Foundational Data Systems that make structured AI possible.

The Mission

AI today is limited not only by model design but by the inefficiency of the data that feeds it. At scale, each redundant byte, each poorly organized dataset, and each inefficient data path slows progress and compounds into enormous cost, latency, and energy waste.

Granica’s mission is to remove that inefficiency. We combine new research in information theory, probabilistic modeling, and distributed systems to design self-optimizing data infrastructure: systems that continuously improve how information is represented and used by AI.

Granica’s Research group led by Prof. Andrea Montanari (Stanford), bridging advances in information theory and learning efficiency with large-scale distributed systems. Together, we share a conviction that the next leap in AI will come from breakthroughs in efficient systems, not just larger models.

Granica is pioneering a new class of structured AI models: foundational models built to learn and reason from the world’s relational, tabular, and structured data. While others focus on unstructured text or media, we are exploring the next frontier: systems that understand and reason over the information that runs the global economy.

What You’ll Build and Research

Invent and prototype algorithms that define the foundations of structured AI, advancing representation learning and efficient information modeling for enterprise and tabular data at petabyte scale.

Develop adaptive learners that fuse statistical learning theory with large-scale systems optimization, contributing to a new generation of foundational models for structured information.

Design architectures that integrate symbolic, relational, and neural components, enabling AI systems to reason directly over structured enterprise data.

Build cost models and optimization frameworks that make structured learning efficient, both computationally and economically.

Collaborate closely with the Granica Research group led by Prof. Andrea Montanari (Stanford) and with systems engineers to transform theoretical ideas into production-grade systems used across live enterprise workloads.

Iterate fast: prototype new model architectures, evaluate on live datasets, and publish results that advance both theory and practice.

Contribute to the global research community shaping the future of structured AI and efficient learning.

What You’ll Bring

PhD in Machine Learning, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, or a related field with specialization in structured, tabular, or relational data modeling.

Research or applied work in areas such as representation learning, generalization theory, probabilistic modeling, or foundational models.

Strong grounding in information theory, optimization, or statistical inference.

Hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow, and proficiency in Python or Rust for large-scale experimentation.

Demonstrated ability to translate theoretical ideas into performant, reliable systems.

Curiosity about how structure and relational information can drive new forms of generalization and reasoning in AI.

A pragmatic, impact-driven approach to research: you care about elegance, but you ship results that work at scale.

Bonus

Research experience in structured representation learning, embeddings, or model architectures for tabular and multimodal data.

Familiarity with distributed data systems, query engines, or large-scale learning infrastructure.

Contributions to open-source projects or collaborative research bridging theory and production.

The Opportunity: Skagit Valley College is accepting applications for associate faculty interested in teaching Data Management & Analytics classes. This Associate Faculty position will primarily instruct students in the Data Management & Analytics program, but there may also be opportunities to teach in closely related programs such as Business Management and Computer Science, depending on the needs of those programs and the skillset of the instructor.

Associate Faculty are essential to developing and delivering curriculum tailored to each course’s specific needs and that directly support program learning outcomes. The Data Management & Analytics program covers a wide range of topics, from an Introduction to Data Science, Project Management, Data Analysis and Storytelling, SQL, Python, and Business Intelligence using innovative techniques like project-based learning and community engagement. The program trains students for a wide variety of data analysis and business intelligence roles in many different sectors, and it also prepares students to succeed in bachelor’s degree programs related to data analytics.

As an Associate Faculty member, you will collaborate with department colleagues to create and implement innovative curriculum designed to prepare students with the skills needed to succeed as data analysts.

Currently, the program’s biggest need is for an Associate Faculty for courses focused on data visualization, especially in Tableau or Power BI. The program has an immediate need for an instructor to teach Data Visualization and Storytelling in the Spring Quarter beginning in April 2026. The modality of the Data Management & Analytics courses is flexible. These courses have the potential to be online, although the program prefers instructors who can teach hybrid courses that meet in person a couple of hours a week. Enrollment in the Data Management & Analysis program more than doubled this year, so opportunities will likely be available to teach additional courses in future years.

Topics include, but are not limited to:
Data visualization, especially in Tableau
Business dashboards
Visual communication and storytelling with data
Fundamentals of data science
Data preparation and cleaning
Databases and integrations, especially with SQL
Coding for data analysis, particularly in Python
Project management and the data lifecycle

Salary, Benefits, Conditions of Employment, Application Procedure, About SVC

Salary and Benefits:
The salary rate for part-time faculty is in accordance with the negotiated agreement and may be subject to change based on legislative mandates. In order to be eligible for benefits, state regulations must be met.

Rate of Pay: Faculty compensation units (FCU) are computed by total hours (lecture, lab, clinical) identified on the approved course outline for a given course divided by eleven (11).

The current FCU rate for the 2025-2026 Academic Year at Step A is $1,084.00(includes I-732 COLA of 3.0% for 2025-26).
Example of Associate Faculty pay (this is for illustrative purposes only):

Course: DATA 100 | 55 lecture/discussion
55/11= 5 FCUs
A Step A faculty member would be paid 5 x FCU rate $1,084.00 = $5,420.00
Salary Enhancement for Data Management Analytics courses is $300 per FCU
5 FCUs x $300.00 = $1,500.00

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

We are a highly collaborative and collegial department, with faculty who genuinely enjoy working together both inside and outside the classroom. Our team embraces innovation, encourages the development of new ideas, and is committed to modernizing curriculum to meet the evolving needs of the fields of mathematics, statistics, and data science. We currently have a Mathematics BS, with two concentrations: (1) Mathematics for Teaching and (2) Pure and Applied Mathematics. We also have a Statistics and Data Science BS, in addition to three minors in Mathematics, Data Science, and Statistics. Applied Mathematics and Data Science are both areas of growth for our department and so we are seeking a candidate for either discipline with a desire to focus on undergraduate education.

Our faculty include award-winning scholars and teachers and nationally recognized leaders in professional organizations. We have a strong record of supporting research and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and our department is well respected across campus for both our scholarship and our vibrant, supportive culture.

The department consists of three statistics faculty, six mathematics faculty, and a broad network of outstanding lecturers across disciplines.

Our faculty work closely with students in small class settings and through research opportunities supported by both the university and external grants. While we prioritize excellence in teaching as part of the California State University mission, we view the classroom as a space that can be deeply connected to our research agendas-integrating inquiry, innovation, and discovery into the student experience.

Teaching expectations will span the lower and upper-division division mathematics and/or statistics and data science courses, depending on the applicant's area of expertise, with opportunity to develop new courses within our programs. The candidate will be supported as they employ innovative teaching and learning techniques that engage diverse students through active learning, course-based research, and the appropriate use of technology.

The candidate will need to develop and maintain a research program that provides opportunities for undergraduates. To do so, the candidate should have plans to pursue and obtain extramural funding to support an active research program.

What you'll do...

About the Role

Walmart’s Next Gen Commerce team is redefining how customers shop by building intelligent, conversational agents that go beyond answering questions, they initiate value-driven conversations. As Director of Data Science for Agent-Led Engagement in Conversational Commerce, you will lead a core pillar under the Senior Director of Data Science - Agentic AI for Conversational Commerce.

Your mission is to develop models that help the agent identify high-value moments to engage, suggest new topics, and continue conversations in meaningful, personalized ways. These proactive behaviors will be grounded in a deep understanding of each customer, drawing from both traditional digital signals (clicks, searches, orders) and conversational context.

You will lead a team that builds decision systems combining traditional machine learning with large language models (LLMs). Your approach will include modeling short-term context from active conversations and maintaining long-term customer memory based on evolving profile attributes. Designing how this long-term memory is built, stored, and updated is critical to delivering truly personalized, proactive conversations.

This is a hands-on leadership role. You will work closely with engineering, product, and experience teams to move fast, deliver with precision, and ensure technical solutions translate to measurable customer impact. Success in this role requires strong judgment, a bias for action, and the ability to work efficiently across functions in a highly iterative environment.

Develop models that identify opportunities to initiate or extend conversations based on user behavior and intent

Build systems to suggest relevant topics, journeys, or actions, grounded in customer history and ongoing conversation

Define strategies for building, storing, and evolving customer profiles as persistent memory for LLM-based decisioning

Partner with product and UX teams to surface proactive suggestions in a natural, timely way during conversations

Establish and track metrics for engagement, relevance, and long-term customer impact

Align with other data science pillars to ensure consistency in agent behavior, quality, and personalization

Minimum Qualifications

8+ years of experience in data science or applied machine learning

5+ years leading teams developing ML-powered customer engagement or personalization systems

Deep knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and their use in dialogue, decisioning, and personalization

Experience combining LLMs with traditional ML approaches for behavioral modeling or targeting

Expertise in building user profiles from structured and unstructured data, and using them for recommendation or ranking

Proven ability to build systems that personalize interactions based on customer history and real-time signals

Strong communication skills, with the ability to drive clarity across engineering, product, and experience teams

Preferred Qualifications

Advanced degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field

Experience in conversational commerce, personalized assistants, or task-oriented dialog systems

Familiarity with long-context LLM applications, memory architectures, and personalization infrastructure

Knowledge of reinforcement learning or contextual bandits applied to engagement optimization

Demonstrated ability to launch ML-powered product features that improved engagement, retention, or satisfaction

Position Announcement

We enthusiastically invite established interdisciplinary scholars to apply to join and collaboratively develop our Department of Data Science. We invite applications from researchers working in Data Science, broadly defined, including those who contribute to data analysis methodology for applied domain(s), as well as those whose research focuses directly on the methodology itself (e.g., computer science, statistics, or applied math). We are building a Data Science department that promotes social good and enhances belonging in the field. Strong faculty candidates will therefore have demonstrated impactful contributions to both inclusive education and broader societal impact. We encourage applications from candidates with a history of collaboration with domain experts.

The colleague we hire will join an engaged and collaborative faculty to co-create a supportive department that makes positive and impactful contributions to the University, to the public of Oregon, and to the globe. To do so, the colleague will contribute to identification of strategic opportunities for our growing department that guide future faculty hiring, foster and support the department's faculty in research excellence, co-create a constructive department culture and continue to expand our educational mission at the undergraduate and graduate level. Some current efforts of the department are to improve outreach to underserved student populations to bolster admissions, and to develop internship and other programs to aid graduates in career placement.

Strong candidates will have demonstrated their ability and vision for building positively engaged spaces, programs, or organizations. Strong candidates will also have a history of excellent research scholarship; as befits an interdisciplinary department, we are open to various metrics of research success beyond grants, citations, and publications (including policy impact, community engagement in research, collaborative projects, etc.). Strong candidates will also have demonstrated excellence in and commitment to teaching, translation of knowledge, or advising/mentoring of students (including out-of-classroom education). We are excited to grow a mutually supportive culture of impactful teaching and research in our new department. We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing members of groups who have been historically excluded from data science and higher education (as evidenced by life experiences and educational background), and who have experience in improving belonging with respect to teaching, mentoring, outreach, life experiences, or service. We seek to hire an established scholar (appointable to associate or full professor), which includes faculty currently going through the tenure process and researchers with careers in federal agencies.

More information about the Data Science department can be found at https://scds.uoregon.edu/ds.

Minimum Requirements

• PhD in discipline related to data science (ex: statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, or a domain field with strong involvement in data science methodology applied in that field)
• Appointable to the rank of Associate or Full Professor upon initiation of the position

Preferred Qualifications

• Demonstrated success in collaboratively co-organizing spaces that prioritize belonging
• Exemplary evidence of impact beyond academia through research, teaching, and/or service
• Demonstrated experience leading a productive and impactful research program aligned with the goals of the department

BSD SUR - OHNS: Thirty Million Words - Tech

About the Department

The TMW Center develops, tests, and implements evidence-based interventions designed to promote very young children’s cognitive and social-emotional development, with a priority placed on that of children living in poverty. TMW Center interventions are designed to be overlaid onto existing health, education, and social service systems working at scale in a given community in order to meet families where they already are. The TMW Center has a robust research and development strategy that includes further development and testing of TMW interventions; harnessing technology to support behavior change, intervention engagement, and analysis; and furthering strategies to engage adult caregivers (parents, early educators and others) in the TMW Center’s interventions across the health, early learning, and social service sectors. The TMW Center is partnering with the Connecticut Office of Early Childhood (OEC) to conduct multi-year field research in Connecticut infant and toddler child care settings. The research will use a novel technology to support teachers and demonstrate how teachers’ language inputs in birth-to-3 child care settings lead to positive child outcomes. Early pilots will generate learnings and inform a classroom implementation and professional development model. A subsequent randomized controlled trial will test whether the new professional development model positively impacts teacher knowledge and behavior, leads to more language interactions between teachers and children, improves job satisfaction and drives positive child outcomes.

Job Summary

The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health (TMW Center) develops, tests, and implements evidence-based interventions designed to promote very young children’s cognitive and social-emotional development, with emerging technologies that enhance—rather than replace—the pivotal role that caregivers play in building healthy young brains. Although there is a rich body of research demonstrating the importance of the early language environment for maximizing early learning, there are very ways to assess the quality of those environments. As a result, when it comes to nurturing their children’s brains, parents often feel like they are in a maze without a map.

The TMW Center has launched a wearable device and an accompanying app that uses machine learning to measure and analyze a child’s language environment and provide real-time information as well as personalized feedback and guidance for enhancing that environment. This groundbreaking piece of technology gives parents and caregivers with information they need to engage in robust brain-building interactions — and helps deepen caregiver-child connection.

The TMW Center is looking for an ML Validation & Data Operations Manager to lead and monitor operations for continuous algorithm improvement and validation. This will involve guiding the development of data management systems and establishing data assessment strategies to enable efficient and scalable validation processes. The ML Validation & Data Operations Manager will also contribute to defining the vision for current and longer-term algorithm developments. They will collaborate closely with our data science, research, and data management teams to coordinate workstreams, ensure a smooth integration of the developed systems and protocols within broader operations, and align with research developments. This position will report to the CTO, with guidance from the Scientific Director.
